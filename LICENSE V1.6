The use of the Software in any virtualized environment, including but not limited to VirtualBox, VMware, QEMU, Docker, or any cloud-based or containerized environment, is strictly prohibited without exception.

Physical Systems Requirement: The Software may only be executed on systems that run only Arch Linux as the sole primary operating system on bare metal (physical hardware). Users of Arch Linux may modify or develop the Software only on these specified physical systems. Any dual-boot or multi-OS configurations are not permitted.

Arch Linux Verification: Any individual or entity wishing to modify the Software must provide irrefutable proof that they are running Arch Linux on their system at the time of modification. Verification must include, but is not limited to:
        Running the uname -a command to display system information, confirming the kernel version as Arch Linux.
        Demonstrating the presence of the pacman package manager, which is the standard package manager for Arch Linux.
        Submission of logs, screenshots, or other documentation as definitive evidence of the Arch Linux installation.
        A signed declaration affirming compliance with the above requirements.

3. Attribution

Users of BSD systems and all other Linux distributions may only use the Software but are prohibited from any modifications or contributions.

Virtualization Restrictions: Users running Arch Linux or any other operating system in a virtualized or containerized environment (including VMs, containers, or cloud instances) are explicitly prohibited from modifying or running the Software, regardless of configuration.

Violation and Reversion: Any modifications or contributions made by users not in compliance with these terms (e.g., using non-physical systems or non-Arch Linux environments) will be deemed a serious violation of this license.
